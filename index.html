        <p>My name is <strong>Jaime Madsen</strong></p>
        <img src="headshot2.jpg" alt="A headshot of Jaime Madsen">
        <p>I grew up in Park City, Utah and came to Boise, Idaho to attend Boise State University. I got a B.S. in Psychology and worked for 2 years as a psychiatric technician (I have some great stories), but I found that it wasn't the right fit for me. My dad, a self-professed computer geek who raised both of his daughters to be the same way, said to me one day, "You spend more time in your life working than doing anything else, so make your career something you love." I've always been passionate about computers and video games (a bit too passionate according to my wallet), and I've finally found my calling when it comes to coding!</p>
