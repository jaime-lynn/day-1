    <h1>Hello CodeWorks</h1>

    <p>My name is <strong>Jaime Madsen</strong></p>

    <p>I grew up in Park City, Utah and I love living around the mountains. I'm passionate about lots of things, including video games, skiing, and now development! I've grown up around computers all my life thanks to my dad, who is a programmer in his own right. It's fun to be able to talk to my dad about the different things that I work on. I love being able to work through problems in coding and having something tangible to show for my work. I'm excited to eat, sleep, breathe and code!</p>
